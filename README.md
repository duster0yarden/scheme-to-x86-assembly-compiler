A chez scheme to x86 assembly compiler, written on ubunto as the final project on Compiler Principles taken in BGU,

Using the compiler :
Assume you have a chez scheme file, foo.scm, that you want to compile, that is located in the project directory,
simply open a terminal, navigate to project directory, and type : "make foo",
this will create an executable foo in the same directory, and also a foo.s which is the assembly file.
